# Data Analytics and Data Science Course Projects by Naurahhana Firdaustsabita

Welcome to my Data Analytics and Data Science learning project repository. This repository showcases learning projects I've worked on, applying various data analysis techniques and tools like Python and R. Each project includes a brief description, data sources, and links to the analysis or dashboards. Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch if you have any questions or feedback!

## Projects

### 1. [Brazilian E-Commerce Dashboard](https://github.com/naurahhanaf/project/tree/main/brazilian-ecommerce-analysis)
A Python-based data analysis project on Dicoding Learning, focused on Brazilian e-commerce dataset from Kaggle.

- **Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Streamlit
- **Objective**: Conducted analysis to identified annual delivery order performance.
- **Outcome**: Interactive dashboard to present informative and easy-to-understand data visualizations.

### 2. [Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis](https://github.com/naurahhanaf/project/tree/main/cyclistic-analysis)
A case study based on the Google Data Analytics Capstone Project, where I analyzed Cyclistic's bike-share data using R.

- **Tools Used**: R (tidyverse, lubridate), RMarkdown
- **Objective**: Analyze trip data to understand how casual and annual members use the service differently.
- **Outcome**: The analysis helped identify key user behavior trends, providing insights for marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

### 3. [Water Potability Prediction](https://github.com/naurahhanaf/project/tree/main/water-potability-prediction)
A supervised machine learning project in the Fundamentals of Data Science course at my college, where I predicted Water Quality datasey from Kaggle.

- **Tools Used** : Python (Pandas, Scikit Learn, Joblib), Streamlit
- **Objective** :  Predict the potability of water, whether the water is safe for human consumption, based on various physical and chemical attributes using a K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
- **Outcome** : A website that designed to help researchers assess water potability based on various water quality parameters.
